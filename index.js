  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:

  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:

  1. Window/global binding. - the value of 'this.' will be entire window object because called on the global scope.


  2. Implicit binding. - the .this keyword will point to the object that is directly before the dot when the function is invoked. Only applies to objects with methods.
  
  
  3. Explicit binding. -using apply,call, bind to explicitly change 'this.' refers to. Call immediately invokes function & passes arguments 1 by 1. Bind passes arguments 1 by 1 but doesnt immediately invoke function. will return brand new function that can be stored for later. Apply will immediately invoke function & pass as an array.




  4. New binding. -uses 'new' keyword to create context for a new object and 'this.' will point to that new object. Using constructor function we can create as a template for that object.
